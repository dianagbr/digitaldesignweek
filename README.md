# Web Design Project - Digital Design Week

## Scenario: Website for a cultural event (Design Festival)

For this individual project, I have chosen to create a website for an online cultural event. I got inspired by all the conferences I took part in this year such as Adobe Max and I decided to do something similar as I thought an event of this type, but destined for the local community of designers and creatives would be something many would appreciate. I saw this class as the perfect opportunity to sharpen my coding skills and therefore I used HTML and CSS to build the website. I used Javascript snippets found on Codepen to add more functionality to it, all of these have been acknowledged in the source code through comments.
